# League of Legends Client

I originally envisioned making all the calls into a wrapper but as I look into more and more of these; not a good idea.
Bastion will wrap the ones that I (or those of you that want it) deem important. You can call any of these endpoints
once a session is made at your own risk.

I'm not sure what ones are accessable to you for sure or ones that you're allowed to access even. Refer to the [league client api](https://developer.riotgames.com/docs/lol#league-client-api)
or their discord for more information.

## Custom Requests
Look at or run the [get_selected_region example](./examples/get_selected_region/get_selected_region.go)
